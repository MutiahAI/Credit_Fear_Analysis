# Credit_Fear_Analysis

This repository leverages the [2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) dataset to identify households encountering challenges in obtaining credit. The primary objective is to develop a segmentation model for these households and create an interactive web application for collaborative exploration and sharing of insights.

### Content:

- **Data:** The Data folder contains the dataset sourced from the [2022 SCF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm).

- **Image:** The image folder contains visualizations linked in the Data_Exploration notebook.

- **Data_Exploration.ipynb:** This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, examining key features.

- **K_means_Clustering.ipynb:** This notebook focuses on constructing a segmentation model using the K-means clustering algorithm. It explores distinctions between clusters identified through unsupervised machine learning. Visualization of multi-dimensional clusters is achieved using principal component analysis (PCA).
